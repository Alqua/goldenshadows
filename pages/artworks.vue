        Yadanar Win is a multimedia artist based in Yangon, Myanmar. With an early interest in
        international exchange, driven by her university studies in English, she joined New Zero
        Art Space as a collaborative member in 2009, after that she involved in the culture scene
        for 9 years not only as an artist but she also organized and coordinated several cultural
        projects and exchanges. Her unique ability to seamlessly join her own body, to the
        document of her performance, and bring them together into an art object is reflective of
        her generation’s willingness to experiment with all mediums and abandon the traditional
        painting and sculpture so common in the Myanmar art scene. Her performances are
        passionate and critical, often citing the plight of Myanmar’s peace process or personal
        struggles as a young female artist under tyranny reign.
